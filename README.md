# **Fundrise and the Future of Real Estate Equity Crowdfunding**

# 

## Overview and Origin

Fundrise was founded in 2010 by brothers Dan and Ben Miller, and it was officially launched in 2012. Prior to founding, the brothers worked at Western Development Corp. in Washington, D.C. and came up with the idea of equity crowdfunding as a means to fund the real estate deals they were working on. Their first investment raised $325,000 from 175 investors, allowing for individual investments as low as $100. Today, Fundrise uses a value investing strategy for buying and improving commercial properties, and allows individuals to invest in its diversified funds.

Fundrise raised $2 million in seed capital in 2010 and an additional $38 million in a Series A round in 2014, totaling $40 milion raised. Some of Fundrise's investors include Guggenheirm Partners, Chinese social networking company Renren, Rockrose's president Justin Elghanyan and CEO of Forest City Commercial Group James Ratner.


## Business Activities

The goal of Fundrise is to make private real estate investing more accessible by implementing a crowdfunding approach to equity and debt investment. A minimum investment of $500 grants an investor access to a diversified "Starter Portfolio" of real estate. Higher tier investors have access to "eREITs" that offer geographically targetted portfolios. Investors who invest at least $10,000 have access to one of Fundrise's three eFunds (which focus on Washington, DC, Los Angeles, and the general national market, respectively), which grant access to more exclusive institutional deals. 

Fundrise's intended customer is a non-accredited investor who would not normally have access to private institutional real estate deals. Their Starter Portfolio plan offers the opportunity for almost anyone to invest in a diversified real estate portfolio, which allows Fundrise to market to far more potential investors than some of its competitors that target accredited investors or have higher investment minimums. In addition, although investments through Fundrise are intended to be longer term, they will liquidate any investment within the first 90 days if requested. 

Even among similar platforms with lower barriers to entry, Fundrise has a first mover advantage in that it is one of the first fintech companies in the real estate equity crowdsourcing space. Founded before the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act went into effect, Fundrise was able to hit the ground running when crowdsourcing became a viable method to raise capital. Also, their focus on Washington, D.C. area real estate as well as the founders' background has allowed them to become established quickly in the region, which has further allowed them to expand elsewhere in the country.

Fundrise uses proprietary accounting and reporting software that allows them to automate much of their operations, which in turn allows them to achieve lower fees than many traditional institutions.

## Landscape

Within Fintech, Fundrise would be classified as a real estate tech company as well as an investment management firm. 

In 2013, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act went into effect, which in turn had a major impact on the real estate investment industry. Prior to the JOBS Act, real estate investment was restricted to private investors or publicy traded real estate investment trusts (REITs). The JOBS Act allowed for crowdfunding to be used as a way to raise capital for real estate deals, which has resulted in several new companies implementing this technology.

Although there are several new companies that use crowdfunding technology to raise capital, there is a degree of diversity in their strategies. For instance, ArborCrowd screens hundreds of deals each year, only to invest in 7, on average, and presents one deal at a time to investors, who must be accredited high net worth individuals to qualify. RealCrowd is another platform that serves as a marketplace where investors and sponsors can interact directly. A typical deal on RealCrowd requires an investment of between $25,000 and $1 million. Groundfloor is another company yet in which for as little as $10, investors can provide short-term loans that are secured by the underlying real estate.

## Results

Since its inception, Fundrise has invested in over $2.5 billion in real estate. They point to their average annualized returns as their core metrics, and they have achieved an average return of over 10%. They claim to earn an annualized dividend yield of 4.15%, outperforming Vanguard's total bond ETF and real estate ETF. 

Currently, Fundrise is one of the largest and most reputed real estate crowdfunding platforms in the country. With an average annualized return hovering around 10%, it has seen consistently solid returns compared with similar platforms. Because of their relative low barrier to entry, Fundrise also has arguably more potential for growth compared to other sites that are only available to higher net worth investors, as it can position itself as an effective way to diversify any portfolio, large or small.

The real estate crowdfunding space in general has enormous potential because even much high and even ultra high net worth investors, crowdfunding platforms are an alternative to REITs (or in some cases are REITs) that offer the ability to invest in diversified real estate portfolios in a way that was not possible prior to the JOBS Act.

## Recommendations

Fundrise places an emphasis on the fact that they use a value investing strategy when looking for properties. As a way to demonstrate the value they offer, it could be helpful if their platform provided an efficient way to compare their offerings with comperables in their respective areas in order to get a better picture of real estate markets that may be unfamiliar to the investor.

Fundrise's website is well laid out and easy to use; however, I learned from another website that they offer a $100,000 minimum premium account option that is very difficult to find on their website. They are probably trying to create an air of exclusivity around this, but I believe they need to present this option as transparently as the others. Otherwise, Fundrise could come across as a platform that markets itself to nonaccredited investors because they are not confident or competent enough to manage the money of higher net worth individuals or insititutions.
